The world is a continuum. Where to draw a boundary around a system depends on the purpose of the discussion.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>For technologists working within teams and wider organisations, a lot can be gained from learning about systems thinking. Throughout <em>Thinking in Systems: A Primer</em>, Donella Meadows puts forward the idea of the world being composed of systems and subsystems, with their own feedback loops that balance and reinforce various behaviours.</p><p>When you work in a team, you will have your own systems and processes in place. You will have a code review system, a workflow system, a CI/CD pipeline that follows its own procedures, with checks and balances built in to ensure that what gets pushed to production is actually &quot;production-ready&quot; (however you may define that). Meadows' writing and examples are clear and accessible, and through reading <em>Thinking in Systems</em>, you will start to get an understanding of how to optimise the systems you work within.</p></div></article></main><hr></div></body></html>
