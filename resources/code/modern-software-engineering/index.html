Almost by definition, engineering is pragmatic.”</p></blockquote><p><em>Modern Software Engineering</em> attempts to reshape what it means to be a software engineer today. The book distances itself from the prevailing ideas of software engineering as a 'craft', and instead argues that software engineers should (re-)adopt a &quot;scientific, rationalist approach&quot;.</p><p>The book facilitates this by focusing the reader on a philosophy of software engineering, as opposed to specific languages, frameworks or technologies. <em>Modern Software Engineering</em> underpins its discussion with the principles of sustainability, maintainability, and resiliency, illustrating countless ways in which these ideas are at the heart of effective software development.</p></div></div><div class="[ flow ]"><img src="/resources/code/modern-software-engineering.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Modern Software Engineering cover" width="250" height="360"> <a class="button" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Modern-Software-Engineering-Really-Better/dp/0137314914">Buy <span class="visually-hidden">Modern Software Engineering</span></a></div></div></article></main><hr></div></body></html>
