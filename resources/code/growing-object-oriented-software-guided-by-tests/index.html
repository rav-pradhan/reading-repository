Projects with late integration start calmly but generally turn difficult towards the end as the team tries to pull the system together for the first time.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Test-Driven Development (TDD) has become one of those concepts that is often misrepresented from its original idea. TDD is a challenging discipline that can feel cumbersome, and as though it is only for purists. But, when done correctly, it's a powerful strategy for developing software that's resilient, well-reasoned, and isn't overengineered.</p><p>Through <em>Growing Object Oriented Software</em>, authors Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce guide you through the process of building a non-trivial application using the <a href="https://medium.com/@adrianbooth/test-driven-development-wars-detroit-vs-london-classicist-vs-mockist-9956c78ae95f">London School of TDD</a> (also known as outside-in TDD). Through this process, you will gain confidence in test-first strategies, and appreciate the values of working in this way.</p></div></article></main><hr></div></body></html>
