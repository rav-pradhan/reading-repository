These issues can pose very real and growing ethical problems for all of us.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Through the case studies of facial recognition technology and the UK's response to COVID-19, Stephanie Hare's primer asks and attempts to answer the the questions: what is technology ethics, and can technology ever be &quot;neutral&quot;?</p><p>Where the book is most insightful is how Hare introduces the reader to six branches of philosophy as a way out analysing these case studies: metaphysics, epistemology, political philosophy, logic, aesthetics, and ethics. It's an introductory resource, but nonetheless a useful one for understanding how to evaluate the ethical considerations for the technologies we build and use.</p></div></div><div class="[ flow ]"><img src="/resources/ethics/technology-is-not-neutral.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Technology Is Not Neutral: A Short Guide To Technology Ethics cover" width="250" height="360"> <a class="button" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Technology-Ethics-Perspectives-Stephanie-Hare/dp/1907994971">Buy <span class="visually-hidden">Technology Is Not Neutral: A Short Guide To Technology Ethics</span></a></div></div></article></main><hr></div></body></html>
