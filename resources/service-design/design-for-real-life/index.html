Instead, Wachter-Boettcher and Meyer persuasively advocate for inclusive, compassionate design principles to underpin service design.</p><p>The book is crammed with scenarios and case studies that highlight how services can harm or evoke negative feelings in people, and puts forward some ways in which these can be mitigated. A short, accessible, and insightful read.</p></div></div><div class="[ flow ]"><img src="/resources/service-design/design-for-real-life.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Design for Real Life cover" width="250" height="360"> <a class="button" href="https://abookapart.com/products/design-for-real-life">Buy <span class="visually-hidden">Design for Real Life</span></a></div></div></article></main><hr></div></body></html>
