At its core, devReads is a collection of articles and books I've read over the years that I believe will help anyone become a more helpful colleague and better web engineer, regardless of disciplines and specific areas of expertise.

As you browse through the collections, you may notice that the items listed are primarily generalist or focus on high level fundamentals. Individual technologies and meta-frameworks are far more transient and static.

I'm a firm believer that there are universal maxims within our profession that is incumbent on us all to take heed of. To do so ensures we build digital services that are inclusive, accessible, and grounded on a resilient technological foundation.
