> "CSS is great, but when you over-engineer and over-complicate it, it can get pretty hairy, pretty quickly. A common, knee-jerk response to this conundrum is to employ the use of a CSS-in-JS library or heavy-duty framework, but that is like taking out a Wonga loan to pay off your house."

Every now and then you come across a resource that revolutionises the way you work and code. It's not hyperbolic at all for me to say that _Every Layout_ has done exactly that for my approach to web design and CSS.

A lot of CSS trends in recent years feel as though they've been designed to override the fundamental premise of CSS - the **cascade**. _Every Layout_ does nothing of the sort, instead embracing with open arms the [algorithmic powers](https://every-layout.dev/blog/algorithmic-design/) that CSS provides.

If you want to better understand the underpinnings of CSS, and as a result become a more proficient web designer, then you owe it upon yourself to check _Every Layout_ out.
