Responsible JavaScript's greatest strength is that it isn't a book that's _just_ about JavaScript.

Of course you'll learn a considerable amount about JavaScript; but the theme that underpins Wagner's arguments is that JavaScript is a single component of the web experience - one that we need to craft with care and attention.

Through this premise, Wagner frames the authorship of JavaScript as an inclusive design concern. It's the users whose web experiences are compromised when we write excessive and inefficient JavaScript that hasn't been built [progressively](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement).

This point is hammered home in every page of the book, and so it serves as an emphatic reminder of the responsibility we have in making the web a space for everyone.
