Responsible JavaScript's greatest strength is that it isn't a book that's _just_ about JavaScript.

Of course, you'll learn a considerable amount about JavaScript by reading this book. But the theme that underpins Wagner's arguments is that JavaScript is but a single component of the web experience - one that we need to craft with care and attention.

By working on that premise, Wagner contextualises the authorship of JavaScript as a web inclusivity and accessibility concern. It is the users whose web experiences are compromised when we write excessive and inefficient JavaScript that hasn't been built with [progressive enhancement](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement).

This point is hammered home in every page of the book, and so it serves as an emphatic reminder of the responsibility we have in making the web a space for everyone.
