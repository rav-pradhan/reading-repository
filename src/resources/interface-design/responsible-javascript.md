Responsible JavaScript's greatest strength is that it isn't a book that's _just_ about JavaScript.

Sure, you will learn an incredible amount about JavaScript by reading this book. But the theme that underpins Wagner's writing is that JavaScript is but a single component of the web experience - one that we need to craft with meaning and deftness.

By working on that premise, Wagner contextualises our writing of JavaScript as a web inclusivity and accessibility issue. It is the users whose web experiences are compromised when we write excessive and inefficient JavaScript that hasn't been built in a [progressive way](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement).

This point is hammered home in every page of the book, and so it serves as an emphatic reminder of the responsibility we have in making the web a space for everyone.
