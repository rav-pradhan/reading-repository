> "If we want to make space for everyone’s lives and needs, we need to account for a broader range of experiences — and a whole host of complicated feelings and emotional responses that can come along with using our interfaces."

*Design for Real Life* argues that there's a need to think beyond traditional design approaches when designing services, because they intrinsically fail to account for the messy realities of everyday life. Instead, Wachter-Boettcher and Meyer persuasively advocate for inclusive, compassionate design principles to underpin service design.

The book is crammed with scenarios and case studies that highlight how services can harm or evoke negative feelings in people, and puts forward some ways in which these can be mitigated. A short, accessible, and insightful read.
