Service design is a challenging space that intersects with myriad disciplines, including user research, interaction design, and software development.

While it is tangential to the day-to-day work of engineers and technologists, service design is nevertheless a discipline that we should strive to have an understanding and appreciation of. A familiarity with service design principles predicated on empathy and compassion is valuable, regardless of where your focus of work is.
