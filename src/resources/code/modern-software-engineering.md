> “Engineering is about adopting a scientific, rationalist approach to solving practical problems within economic constraints, but that doesn’t mean that such an approach is either theoretical or bureaucratic. Almost by definition, engineering is pragmatic.”

*Modern Software Engineering* attempts to reshape what it means to be a software engineer today. The book distances itself from the prevailing ideas of software engineering as a 'craft', and instead argues that software engineers should (re-)adopt a "scientific, rationalist approach".

The book facilitates this by focusing the reader on a philosophy of software engineering predicated on systems thinking, as opposed to prevailing ideas associated with specific languages, frameworks or technologies. *Modern Software Engineering* illustrates in countless ways how this philosophy is at the heart of effective software development.
