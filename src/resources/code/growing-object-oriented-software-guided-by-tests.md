> "Fred Tingey, a colleague, once observed that incremental development can be disconcerting for teams and management who arenâ€™t used to it because it front-loads the stress in a project. Projects with late integration start calmly but generally turn difficult towards the end as the team tries to pull the system together for the first time."

Test-Driven Development (TDD) has become one of those concepts that is often misrepresented from its original idea. TDD is a challenging discipline that can feel cumbersome, and as though it is only for purists. But, when done correctly, it's a powerful strategy for developing software that's resilient, well-reasoned, and isn't overengineered.

Through _Growing Object Oriented Software_, authors Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce guide you through the process of building a non-trivial application using the [London School of TDD](https://medium.com/@adrianbooth/test-driven-development-wars-detroit-vs-london-classicist-vs-mockist-9956c78ae95f) (also known as outside-in TDD). Through this process, you will gain confidence in test-first strategies, and appreciate the values of working in this way.
