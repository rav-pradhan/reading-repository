Every now and then you come across a resource that revolutionises the way you view a strand of your work. It's not hyperbolic at all for me to say that _Every Layout_ has done exactly that for the way I work in web design and CSS.

A lot of CSS trends in recent years feel as though they've been designed to eschew with the fundamental premise of CSS - the **cascade**. _Every Layout_ does nothing of the sort, instead embracing with open arms the [algorithmic powers](https://every-layout.dev/blog/algorithmic-design/) that CSS proffers.

If you want to better understand the underpinnings of CSS, and as a result become a more proficient web designer, then you owe it upon yourself to check _Every Layout_ out.
