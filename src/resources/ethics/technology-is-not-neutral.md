> "It seems that just about every new technology that we bring to bear on improving our lives brings with it some downside, side effect or unintended consequence. These issues can pose very real and growing ethical problems for all of us."

Through the case studies of facial recognition technology and the UK's response to COVID-19, Stephanie Hare's primer asks and attempts to answer the the questions: what is technology ethics, and can technology ever be "neutral"? 

Where the book is most insightful is how Hare introduces the reader to six branches of philosophy as a way out analysing these case studies: metaphysics, epistemology, political philosophy, logic, aesthetics, and ethics. It's an introductory resource, but nonetheless a useful one for understanding how to evaluate the ethical considerations for the technologies we build and use.
