Systems Thinking is a holistic, analytical framework that views everything observable in the world as a series of systems, connected through a series of feedback loops.

Whilst it's a discipline that isn't exclusively concerned with software engineering, the underpinning ideas of systems thinking are nevertheless significant when working in software. Systems thinking is particularly effective as a framework for understanding ways to optimise contiuous delivery and improvement within teams and digital services.
