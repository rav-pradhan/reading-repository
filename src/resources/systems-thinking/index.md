title: "Systems Thinking"
---

Systems Thinking is a holistic, analytical framework that views everything observable in the world as a series of systems interlocking and interfacing through a mixture of feedback loops.

Whilst it's a discipline that isn't exclusively concerned with web development, the underpinning ideas of systems thinking are nonetheless incredibly pertinent when working in software. Whether it's within ourselves, our teams, or the wider organisations we work with, the composite of systems that govern the interactions and interplay between these can be analysed through systems thinking, and consequently optimised.
