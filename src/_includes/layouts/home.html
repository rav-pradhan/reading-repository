    In an attempt to better record and reflect on what I've read, I've set up
    this catalogue of books.

  <p>
    You'll mainly find reading that's aimed at software professionals and
    technologists who want to get better at designing and building digital
    services. There are also some reading that focuses on the wider societal
    impacts of technologies.
